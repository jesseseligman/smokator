Smokator is mobile web application that seeks to improve the process of acquiring cigarettes from strangers in a bar.

Many people who are casual smokers who don't carry cigarettes have the problem of not having cigarettes on hand when they want them.

Our project solves this problem by providing a tool for quickly and easily locating someone who is willing to give you a cigarette.

Smokator requires two types of users to provide input. First, "givers" must sign up as being available to give cigarettes at a bar. Then, "bummers" can sign into a bar and see which "givers" hve posted themselves at that bar.

Outputs that are produced are a list of "givers" available for "bummers" to choose from and chat with if they wish.

We used the Google Places API as well as TextBelt for SMS messaging.

We used React.js with Material UI in the front-end. In the back-end we used Node.js and Express for building our server. We used Knex for connecting our Express server to a PostgreSQL database. We also used Socket IO for building out our chat feature.
